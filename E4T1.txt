As a Cloud Architect, you have been asked to apply security best practices to the environment so that it can withstand attacks and be more secure.

Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
1. configure SSH authentication using private key (disable SSH authentication using password)
2. configure the security group to only allow connections to port 5000 gtom the Load Balancers

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
3. restrict the S3 IAM policy to access only the free recipes S3 bucket
