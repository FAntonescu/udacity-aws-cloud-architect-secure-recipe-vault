You will need to determine appropriate tools to incorporate into the pipeline to ensure that security vulnerabilities are found.

Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: (For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.)
a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 
- TFLint - a Terraform linter used for scanning Terraform templates for security vulnerabilities
- Terrafirma - a static code analysis for Terraform
- Terrascan

example compliance violation: aws_iam_account_password_policy - Setting a lengthy password increases account resiliency against brute force login attempts

b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
- Amazon Inspector
- Suavei Internet Security (Scanner AMI)
- JFrog XRay 

example: runC Root Access Remote Execution.

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
- AWS Config
- Cloud Custodian

example: too permissive IAM permissions
