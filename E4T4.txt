Questions and Analysis

1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
By using a Web Application Firewall it would be possible to detect more types of web attacks.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
The S3 endpoints are accessible from any EC2 endpoint as long as the S3 bucket IAM permissions are insecure. 
Adding more private VPC endpoints does not ensure that unauthorized accesses to S3 will not happen, 
because of the risk of chaining vulnerabilities and the remaining posibility of reaching the secret S3 bucket.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, the encryption is applied only to the new file resources addedd to the bucket.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
In the event that the CloudFormation stacks would be re-created, the same vulnerabilities would be re-created as well. 
The changes with the fixies should be permanently applied in the YAML files descriptor files.
