1. The S3 IAM role allows any opperation on any resource, effectively allowinng admin access to S3, which is a security risk. 
The persmissions should be restricted to include only the needed read operations on the public bucket only

2. The web application is deployed in the public sub-network, which is increasing the attack surface.
Instead, the web application should be deployed in the private subnet.

3. The security group of the web application is allowing to broad access from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) to the SSH and HTTP ports. 
Instead, the access should be restricted to allow ingress conenctions only from the load balancer security group on the port 5000. 
The SSH access should be allowed only from the private network.
The egress access to the Internet should be allowed only through a NAT gateway combined with a web proxy for controlling the list of whitelisted Internet domains.
